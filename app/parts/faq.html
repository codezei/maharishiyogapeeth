                    How long should you do yoga before starting yoga teacher training ?

                    Ideally, you should have already attended a few yoga classes before starting your yoga teacher
                    training. We encourage
                    you to focus on completing your training. Western yoga is very different from traditional yoga. Our
                    classes build slowly
                    so you can learn all about asanas, pranayama, meditation, and more, from beginner to advanced.

                    Maharishi Yoga Peeth teaches traditional yoga, also known as hathasana, and the philosophy of
                    Ashtanga Yoga (the eight
                    parts). Our approach is to look at the individual and teach you how to bring perfect health to your
                    body and others.
                    First, we need to understand the common complaints and problems of today. Once you understand this
                    and understand the
                    benefits and caveats of asana and pranayama techniques, you can decide which techniques to use to
                    create healthy,
                    physical, and mental well-being.
